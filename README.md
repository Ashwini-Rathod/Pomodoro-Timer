# Pomodoro-Timer
This is a pomodoro timer application which will help the user to manage his/her task with a pre-set timer. 

The timer has three modes namely Pomodoro, Short-break and Long-break. Pomodoro is basically the time assigned for doing a perticular task followed by a short break. The cycle of pomodoro and short break continues for a particular number and then the long break timer is initiated.

The application has a default work time as 25mins, default short-break time as 5mins and default long-break time as 15mins. After the completition of 25mins of work, an alert is initiated asking the user to take a break and the short break timer is initiated. This completes 1 cycle. As the 5 mins of the short-break expires, an alert pops ups, asking the user to start the task again. This way the cycle continues for a specified number and then after that specified number, an alert pops up asking the user to take a long-break. This application runs for 2 complete cycles and then pops an alert for long break and starts the timer for the same.

The application also allows the user to set the work and short-break time according to their convenience. Pause and Reset buttons are provided to pause the timer at any state of time. Reset will reset all the timer values.

The application is designed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Also, the application is made responsive using media queries.
